## ðŸŒ± Indoor Plant Website

This project is an indoor plant-themed website created as part of a university web development assessment. The goal was to build a functional, responsive and interactive website using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, while demonstrating a wide range of front-end development concepts.

### Form for Demonstration Only

The **Personalised Plant Recommendations** form is for demonstration purposes only. It does not submit any data or store personal information.

### How to Test the Growth Tracker Feature with Plant Data

To test the functionality of the **Growth Tracker** feature on the website, you can download the **plant-data.csv** file and use it to simulate plant data.

1. **Download the Plant Data CSV**  
- Download the **plant-data.csv** file from the repository

2. **Upload the CSV file to the website**  
- Once youâ€™ve downloaded the CSV file, you can upload it using the file input on the Growth Tracker feature
